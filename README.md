# Enchanted Escape
## Creative Code Lab 4 - Group 1

### Story
Lost in the depths of a dark, enchanted forest, you stumble upon an eerie, ancient hut. Rumors among villagers speak of a sinister witch who dwells here, weaving spells and concocting potions. Seeking refuge from the brewing storm, you enter the hut, but the door slams shut behind you, trapping you inside. The air is thick with magic, and you hear the witch's cackle echoing around you. Now, you must find a way to escape before the witch returns.

As you explore the witch's hut, you encounter a room filled with mysterious and magical items. Shelves are lined with old spell books, strange potions bubble on the tables, and peculiar artifacts are scattered throughout. The hut seems to be alive, with hidden mechanisms and enchanted locks guarding its secrets.
Your goal is to solve the various puzzles within the hut. Each puzzle you solve brings you closer to uncovering the secrets of the witch's magic and finding the key to escape. The atmosphere is tense, with the constant fear of the witch's imminent return urging you to hurry.
